# CR-Unlocker-Reborn
A tool that will proxy the Crunchyroll Session ID through a US server.

## What is the CR-Unblocker-Reborn?
The CR-Unblocker-Reborn will get an American Session ID and sets it as your current Session ID. Like this Crunchyroll will think you are located in America and therefore you should have access to all anime you couldn't watch.

## How does CR-Unblocker-Reborn work?
It simply proxies the `auth/v1/token` endpoint through a US socks proxy.

## Instructions
1. Get a working US Socks proxy.
2. Add the proxy details in `background.js` at line 5.
3. Load the Extension in Firefox.
4. Use Crunchyroll Beta to view animes.
